# SDE-Intern-Projects-In-DNV
A webapge application and a desktop application
This are the projects I made when I worked as a software engineer in DNV.

1. The first project is a web application, I use Python TKinter and HTML, CSS and other tech skills to complete.
2. The second project is a desktop application, It is a INI files operator to implement create, read, update and delete function, also this desktop application connect with ArcGIS.
